# patients

This repo was created to hold my current portfolio project that creates a database using PostgreSQL to hold patient information, including their glasses and contact lens prescriptions, if active.
I've been halted by a few problems, such as completing my API for appropriate HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT), but I'm still determined to continue and adding more features to this project.
